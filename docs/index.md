## Intro to Comptutational Systems Biology

This is a series of modules that are intended to provide simple interfaces to example systems models and to provide extra practice problems and are intended as a supplement the textbook: A First Course in Systems Biology . The textbook is not needed to be able to use these applications, but may be useful for further explanation.

### Markdown
1. [Intro to Modeling](https://kieslich.shinyapps.io/sysBio1/): Provides interfaces to selected examples from Chapter 2: Introduction to Mathematical Modeling of A First Course in Systems  Biology. The expected outcomes of this module are (i) learn the parts of a model and (ii) practice predicting how perturbations to model inputs and parameters affect the model response.

2. [Static Network Models](https://kieslich.shinyapps.io/sysBio2/):
Module 2: Static Network Models provides interfaces to example static network models in line with Chapter 3: Static Network Models of A First Course in Systems Biology. The expected outcomes of this module are (i) learn the basics of working with graphs; (ii) practice computing statistics based on graphs; (iii) practice using stoichiometric network models.


Discrete, Recursive Models
Module 3: Discrete, Recursive Models provides interfaces to example discrete and recursive models, including examples from Chapter 4: The Mathematics of Biological Systems of A First Course in Systems Biology. The expected outcomes of this module are (i) learn the basic principles of discrete, recursive models; (ii) explore examples of dynamic discrete recrusive models; (iii) practice generating Markov matrices.


Canonical Models
Module 4: Canonical Models provides interfaces to example models based on the canonical models described in pg. 102-105 of Chapter 4: The Mathematics of Biological Systems of A First Course in Systems Biology. The expected outcomes of this module are to learn the basic structure of (i) linear, (ii) Lotka-Voltera, (iii) mass action, and (iv) S-system models.


Analysis of Dynamic Models
Module 5: Analysis of Dynamic Models provides interfaces to example models described in Chapter 4: The Mathematics of Biological Systems of A First Course in Systems Biology. The expected outcomes of this module are to learn the fundamentals of stability analysis including: (i) linearization of nonlinear models, (ii) eigenvalue analysis.
